# This is currently in development

>Basic login system working with password exiry and change  
- [ ] Need to add new user creation with password generation and email  
- [ ] Need password change screen to generate / suggest password using **pwqgen**  
- [ ] Need to implement logout if idle for 10 mins (configure in profile?) 


Currently having an issue where password change does not seem to be calling password_change_script.php after submit.
Also trying to work out how to call logout.php from index.html (maybe change to index.php?), to ensure logged out if some start playing with URL.
Also need to ensure that if user logs in but password is expired, that loggedin is set to FALSE so that if someone
chenges password_change.php to main_menu.php they are not logged in .. instead get dumped back to inde.html
